    "# FAI Coursework One - Game Search [15 Marks]\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of coursework one is to give you first-hand experience on implementing search techniques for solving the problems in Python, one of the mostly adapted high level languages and analytic tools in business and research. The questions are designed to help on your understanding of concept of `minimax`, `alpha-beta prunning`, `adversrial problem formulation` and `heuristics` and their implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In completion of this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Students are expected to master the knowledge of formulating adversrial game problem like `gobang` and `tic-tac-toe` game.\n",
    "- Students are expected to use adversrial search algorithms to solve the `gobang` game problem.\n",
    "- Students are expected know how to design and implement the **hearistics** to estimate the **untility value** of the **non-terminal** game board state of the `gobang` game, and evluating the posibility of a player winning the game.\n",
    "- Students are able to use the hearistics to improve the efficiency of `adversrial search`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this coursework, you are required to complete the implementation of `limited minimax search` and `limited alpha-beta search` methods for the `gobang` game, using a fixed depth of recursion and heuristic evaluation of non-terminal states. \n",
    "\n",
    "To finish this coursework, please study the python implementation of `tic-tac-toe game` problem and `alpha-beta search` algorithm in demo code `Game Search*.ipynb` and complete the implementation of `limited minimax search`, `limited alpha-beta search` methods and `goBang` class with the following **requirements**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `limited minimax search` and `limited alpha-beta search` will only considered `limited depth` of recursion (only considers a fixed number of moves ahead), instead of searching the game state until the terminal states.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `limited minimax search` and `limited alpha-beta search` will make decision based **estimation** of the non-terminal state utility, rather than evaluating the **real** terminal state utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The algorithm must alternate between maximizing and minimizing the utility at each level of the tree, as in the original minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There is a valid **heuristics** method implementation in `gobang` class to estimate **non-terminal** game board utility. \n",
    "\n",
    "        Heuristics are rules of thumb or shortcuts that are used to solve problems quickly and efficiently. They are often used when the optimal solution is too complex or too time-consuming to find. In the context of adversarial search, heuristics are used to estimate the utility of non-terminal game states. Heuristics can be based on domain-specific knowledge, such as the value of individual pieces in a chess game, or they can be based on general principles, such as the number of open lines in a game of Go. Heuristics are not guaranteed to provide an optimal solution, but they can be very effective in practice, especially when combined with other search techniques such as alpha-beta pruning.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The **Agent** player, using `limited minimax search` or `limited alpha-beta search`, can play the game intelligently. => When play the `gobang` game against a human player, **Agent** will not lose the game within **20 steps**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The **Agent** player, using `limited minimax search` or `limited alpha-beta search`, can play the game efficiently. => When play the `gobang` game against a human player, **Agent** make every move within **20 seconds**.\n",

    "\n",
    "As you should know, there is no tolerance of plagiarism, and any breach of which will be dealt with according to the University's standard policies. Please be very careful not to cross the boundary into plagiarism while having general discussions regarding the coursework to promote the generation of new ideas and to enhance the learning experience. The important part is that when you sit down to actually do the work and write the answers, you do it individually. If you do this, and you truly understand what you have written, you will not be guilty of plagiarism. Do NOT, under any circumstances, share code or share figures, graphs or charts, etc.\n",
